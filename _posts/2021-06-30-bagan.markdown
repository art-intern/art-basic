### The Temples of Bagan
The thousands of temples that are spread across the plains of Bagan (sometimes spelt Pagan) are the most impressive testament to the religious devotion of Myanmar’s people – and rulers – over the centuries. They combine to form one of the richest archaeological sites in Asia and provide views quite unlike anywhere else on earth. For practical information on restaurants, ATMs, accommodation and trasport, visit our towns of Bagan page.

  

One of the beauties of spending time in what is now officially called the Bagan Archaeological Zone (which also comprises four main settlements) is that, once you have paid your K25,000 entry fee, you have the freedom to explore this vast and fascinating area at your own leisure – the entry ticket is valid for three days. Bagan is in general more touristy and possibly less of the ‘real Myanmar’ than other parts of the country, but despite obvious sales ploys such as the multitudes of children selling hand-drawn postcards, you will rarely suffer the hard sell – and the locals remain warm and friendly.

### A brief history of Bagan

Bagan was **the capital of the Kingdom of Pagan** from the 9th to the 13th centuries. This kingdom was the first to unify the area that is now Myanmar, establishing the **Burmese culture and ethnicity, as well as Theravada Buddhism**, in the region. Over this period of rule, as the city and kingdom grew in influence and stature, **over 10,000 temples were built** on the plains surrounding the capital next to the Irrawaddy River.

After Mongol invasions eventually led to the fall of the Kingdom of Pagan, the city was reduced to a small settlement, never to recover its former glories. The area did, however, remain a **destination for Buddhist pilgrimage**. A few hundred temples were added between the 13th and 20th centuries, but the extensive earthquake damage over the years means that only 3,800 monuments of various size remain, in varying states of repair.
